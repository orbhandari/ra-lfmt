Update: While I do have plans to finish this some day, I've been super busy with courses, internships and other projects. At the moment, I've only reached Chapter 5 of this book.

Solutions typeset in LaTex by me, an _undergraduate_ student, for the recent textbook Real Analysis - A Long Form Mathematics Textbook. The answers are not guaranteed to be correct, and there will be the occasional typos. So, feel free to contact me and correct the mistakes! :)
